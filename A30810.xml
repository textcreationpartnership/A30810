         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ear friend, I ſpeak to thy conſcience in much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto thy Soul: Learn to fear the great God more and more: For bleſſed is the man that feareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes: Wait upon the Lord, and he ſhall renew thy ſtrength: Go unto him, as unto thine exceeding joy: Love all the appearances of his Son, as the comfort of Saints in all generations: Watch over thine own heart; Stand in awe and ſin not: Let the Lord come into his Temple, and Worſhip him alone: Take heed of every gin and ſnare of the old ſerpent, who is in a great rage, becauſe he hath but a ſhort time: Be ſober and quiet in thy Spirit, and hear the Lord ſpeak; His word is nigh thee, within thee, walk in the ſtrength of it, and this will keep thee from the paths of the deſtroyer: Long in thy Spirit to ſee the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the new Heavens, and the new earth, wherein dwels righteouſneſſe: Let thy moderation be known to all men; for the Lord, the deſire of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is at hand: Stand ſtill, be calm, be meek, and thou ſhalt ſee his ſalvation: Let thy Spirit groan and travel in pain with longing to ſee the Lord ariſing to work; For men abuſed by the old Dragon ſeek to make void his Law: And among all the vanities which I have ſeen under the Sun, take heed of the two fooliſh, blind, mad, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Ranters and Quakers: The former of which I have ſeen the Lord ſcatter, and appear in great wrath to conſume, rebuking the evil Spirit in them, and laying them open to their ſhame among their enemies: The latter of theſe I have had ſome dealings with, and finde them more furious and raging than all that have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and notwithſtanding all their ſhew of holineſſe, wiſdom, humility, temperance; yet, by a little dealing with them, I finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but impurity, folly, pride, madneſſe, even to admiration and
<pb facs="tcp:47261:3"/> wonder, in all their doting questions, fowl mouthed anſwers, vain janglings, railing accuſations, even as if Satan had left all others, and brought all his power along with him, to fill their hearts and tongues with all manner of blaſphemies and evil ſpeakings againſt all others, but their own deluded party: And ſtrange it is to ſee, how Satan in them is divided againſt Satan: Satan rails, blaſphemes; and then to ſave himſelf, cries out, 't is Satan he blaſphemes and and rails at in others: The Devil mocks, jeers, ſcoffs, rages in their filthy hearts and tongues; and when he is ſeen and manifeſted by his carriage to be the evil one, preſently he condemnes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſayes 't is the Devil all my fury is powred out upon, 't is him I condemne in men and women, not the ſimilitude of God, the man, or woman to whom I ſpeak: Thus the Lyar and the Murderer in theſe men raging, ſpeaks to excuſe himſelf from his lying and murdering, by perſwading ſimple people, 't is himſelf he aimes at: And yet ſuch a ſtrong inchantment I finde in this mad carriage, that ſome poor Souls are even overcome with their violence, and have thrown away not the light and grace of God onely, that once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in them in ſhew, but even their reaſon and humanity too, and ſubjected themſelves to this carnal yoke, for fear of being ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Devil; Take one paſſage of a great Prophet of their own, one <hi>Tho. Law-Cock,</hi> who, meeting at one Goodman <hi>Matthews</hi> houſe near me, was called aſide by the woman of the houſe, of good report, but almoſt turned a Quaker; to whom the woman in kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſaid, Sir, will you eat ſomething which I have provided? The Quaker replied, What ſhall I eat with Devils and Dogs? and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Dog, There's thy Companion, thy fellow-creature, of the ſame nature with thy ſelf, (ſaith the Quaker) and ſhall I eat with thee a Devil, a Dog? And was not this a good argument at the firſt meeting to perſwade the woman to be a Quaker? And when the woman began to reply ſomething to excuſe her great ſin of asking this man of God (as he calls himſelf) to eat, he opens his box again, and calls her Whore and Harlot; and was not this another good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb facs="tcp:47261:3"/> to perſwade her? And yet this woman, and the man too, begins to believe in the Quakers, and to admire their light and power, luſting after the painted image, and innocent ſpotleſſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe poor deluded wretches have ſet up and made: And as they have dealt with this woman, ſo with ſome others whom I know, prevailing with them, and upon them, even by the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical power of Satans workings in them: Therefore it behooveth us all to look to our building upon the Rock; to our intereſt in the holy one of God, to our receiving and walking in Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, rooted and built up in him, that ſo the gates of Hell may not prevail againſt us.</p>
            <p>Further, a little to lay open this blinde ſeer <hi>Lawcock,</hi> at one meeting with ſome Baptiſts, he was demanded whether Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and died at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> His anſwer was, <hi>That Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but Chriſt did not die,</hi> and yet it was not Chriſt who ſuffered neither, but that which was born of the Virgin: See here his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of himſelf, and his contempt and denyall of the death of Chriſt: And yet afterwards at another meeting, being in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, I charged him with this, and he preſently cried out, Thou lyeſt, <hi>I acknowledge Chriſt both ſuffered and died;</hi> and yet this man muſt be infallible in the midſt of all theſe contradictions againſt himſelf. Further, at the ſame meeting, when I was preſent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to lay open his folly, (the Quaker exhorting to meekneſſe and ſilence, and the like, but preſently falling a railing, curſing, and roaring against Prieſts and hirelings) I asked him in patience how theſe ſpeeches could hang together, we must be meek, calm, quiet, but he muſt roar and rage? At the first daſh the man cries out, thou lyeſt, thou art a beast, and the like: and entreating the man to ſit down, and be meek, according to his own ſpeech, he foams out his own ſhame ſtill: A litte after, wondring at the madneſſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, at the trouble and torment of the evil Spirit in him, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to ſpeak but two words of ſenſe and reaſon, and I would be ſilent, the man roars again, Thou art a belly-god, thou art a
<pb facs="tcp:47261:4"/> beast: And is not this a goodly Apoſtle, Prophet, Teacher? Let all men judge that will not be like the beaſts, unreaſonable. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deſiring a Scripture to maintain ſomething, he ſpake againſt the prieſt-hood, he cries out, wilt thou believe nothing but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? Thus the man can add and take away at his pleaſure, though ſuch are accurſed of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22, 18. Further applying the ſpeech of Chriſt unto himſelf; before <hi>Abraham was, I am,</hi> I asking him whether he was not aſhamed, did ever Saint apply that unto himſelf? He anſwered, he underſtood it of the Spirit that was within him, blaſphemouſly applying the Divine Spirit that dwelt in the Son of God, to the filthy Spirit of <hi>Belial</hi> that dwelt in him: And yet this man muſt be perfect, ſinleſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. But to let him alone with his father, the Devil, and to come to another, with whom I had ſome dealing by conference, and by queſtions and anſwers, and replies on both ſides: This man was one <hi>Thomas Lawſon,</hi> who had a companion with him; This man and his companion I finde contradicting the other in two things. 1. <hi>Lawcock,</hi> he owns the ſufferings of Chriſt, but not his dying; yet another time, both his ſuffering and dying: But <hi>Lawſon</hi> ſcoffs at the ſufferings and dying of Chriſt in the fleſh, as none of his Croſſe, as you ſhall ſee in his papers: Here's no Harmony you ſee amongſt the Quakers, but Quaker againſt Quaker, one againſt another. 2. <hi>Lawſon</hi>'s companion told me he was Chriſt, and what he ſpake was Scripture; This <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> yielded unto by his ſilence; But <hi>Lawcock</hi> denied this ſpeech, and his brethren in it, though he ſaid in effect as much, when he cried out; Before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, I am, yet he would not be Christ: Still here's Satan divided againſt Satan, and ſo it muſt be, that his Kingdom may fall. And yet theſe wretched men delude poor people, and ſay, that at the meetings of Quakers in the North, when there have been three hundred and five hundred Quakers together, they have been all of one heart, and one minde, and ſo they are indeed, being all under the power of the Prince of the air,
<pb facs="tcp:47261:4"/> the Spirit that now works in all the Children of diſobedience, where I leave them in chains of darkneſſe to the judgement of the great day.</p>
            <p>As concerning their queſtions propounded to me in writing, I gave them but a brief anſwer, not minding to make any thing publick unto the world, knowing mine inability to come forth in print in the midſt of ſuch a variety of judgements abroad; yet receiving a reply from <hi>Lawſon,</hi> full of lying and railings, and evil ſurmiſings, I was preſſed in my ſpirit to give ſome ſatisfaction unto my friends of theſe mens folly and madneſſe, as alſo of mine own experiences in the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God with me, ſo far as concerns the matter in hand: And therefore, my dear hearts, put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand in the midst of all the windes and ſtorms of Satans fury, lean to the Rock Chriſt, wherein is everlaſting ſtrength to keep you in this hour of temptation and confuſion; Own the unity of the ſpirit, the ſeed of God in all your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in tribulation, and make this the bond of peace. All ye whoſe faces are toward <hi>Sion,</hi> fall not out by the way: Live in peace and love. Though there be a variety of wayes thither according to Gods Divine diſpenſations, yet in all the wayes of God there is an Unity and Harmony, as they tend to one point and center of rest and joy in himſelf. Make him thine aim then, he is the <hi>Sion</hi> we are all going unto: Be not diſcouraged by the way, though ſome draw back, others grow weary, others ſtep aſide, others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and blaſpheme: Look thou to God, he is thy father, thou art his Son and Heir. Let all thy knowledge, and wiſdom, and light, and graces, and comforts thou hast received from God, make thee not great and high, and ſomething, but little, and low, and nothing ſtill in thine own eſtimation: Take heed of Thorns and Bryars, and Chaffe, and this untoward generation of Godleſſe, ſhameleſſe men: And ſo I commend thee unto him, who is able to keep thee from falling, and to preſent thee blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe before the Throne of his glory, to whom be praiſe and
<pb facs="tcp:47261:5"/> dominion in the Church by Jeſus Chriſt, throughout all ages, world without end.</p>

The cry of the ſoul in this ſtate of loneneſſe is all for God, and the will of God, its riſen as it were out of the world, and gone away from all other company to enjoy a fuller ſight of the Lords beauty, and to have a more exact communion with his Majeſtie: And this is a wilderneſſe a gracious heart delights much to be in.</p>

Man can no more feed upon the fruit which grows upon this Tree of life, which is Chriſt, till Chriſt awake and ariſe in the center of his ſoul, and carry him through all the Trees of temptation, or the pleaſures, pompe, and glory of the outward world, into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or holy, pure element of this ſpirituall body, and pure nature, and there awaken him to eat of the Tree of life, and live for ever: And this is the way whereby I and all the Sons of God come to paſſe from

            <p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47261:9"/> their Souls: In brief, Chriſt ſent out his Diſciples to declare himſelf, to preach ſalvation in his name, and to perſwade the vvorld to faith and meekneſſe, and love and ſelf-denial, &amp;c. through their taking in Chriſt to work all theſe in their Souls: And yet they were to give every outward perſon, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance God was to make uſe of, or had made uſe of before, its due reſpect, plate and ſeaſon.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The beaſt is the wiſdom and underſtanding of the fleſh, or ſpirit of man, which in the various turnings, windings, appearances, and comings of it forth, according to the reaſon and wiſdom, and apprehenſions of men in the dark world of fleſh and bloud, is like unto a party coloured, or ſpotted beaſt, ſuch as the Leopard is: Hence it's written, can the Leopard change his ſpots? Can the wiſdom of the fleſh, and the beſtial man change his fowl and beaſtly abominations of all ſorts, which ſtick and grow up in his nature? Beſides. I have read of the Leopard, that it is an exceeding wilde beaſt, that cannot be tamed, very furious and malicious againſt the very image of a man, and very cunning and crafty in catching of his prey: Such is the nature of fleſhly wiſdom and fleſhly men, they cannot be tamed, but are ſtill full of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt the image, or true appearances of God in man, and very cunning to prey upon the righteous ſeed, ſeeking to devour the man-childe as ſoon as ever he appears to be born in the vvorld: This is the beaſt which is like unto a Leopard.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some make him the Pope, but I never yet found all the vvorld wondring after him, though he be the beaſt in an outward eminent figure, and have many vvorſhippers and followers in the vvorld: But the beaſt is the fleſhly wiſdom, or ſpirit of man, which is alwayes ſetting up a falſe Chriſt or anointed one in the place and office of Chriſt unto us, either our own righteouſneſſe, or our own wit and carnal reaſon, which teacheth us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God, and to ſubſiſt of our ſelves, live of our ſelves, be wiſe of our ſelves, vvorſhip of our ſelves: So that fleſh with all the wiſdom and power of it, is the beaſt that all the vvorld willingly wonders after, inſomuch that they are naturally conſtrained, compelled, and overcome to its obedience, which is their wondering after the beaſt.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The number of the beaſt is the number of a man, though to thoſe who are deceived by him, he appears as a God that cannot erre; yet to the man that hath underſtanding, or his eyes opened through the anointing of God, he hath but the perfection and compleatneſſe of a man, who in the height of all his imaginary compleatneſſe and fulneſſe in himſelf, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is but a poor, empty, miſerable ſhadow, altogether lighter than vanity; This is the number, or ſumme of all the power and wiſdom of the fleſh; It is but an imagination of compleatneſſe and fulneſſe, it is not perfection and fulneſſe it ſelf, and ſo it leaves a man where it findes him in a poor, miſerable, imperfect, and undone eſtate: And therefore the number of the beaſt is but 666. it reaches not to the bringing of a man to the number ſeven, or to a ſtate of perfection, reſt, and fulneſſe, but ſtill leaves in the number 6. or in a ſtate of weakneſſe, bondage, miſerie, even like a poor wretched ſinfull man.</p>

What power able to make war with mine? And in this ſtate and Pomp ſhe rides on, crucifying to her utmoſt skill, all the appearances of Chriſt in the glory and Kingdom of his father, or all higher and lower diſcoveries of God in his Saints, breathing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bloud, perſecution, and blaſphemy againſt the Tabernacle of God, and them that dwell in Heaven: And ſo the falſe, and formal Church, and Chriſtian are the great vvhore, who denies the Lord to be her husband, and being married to her own fleſhly reaſon, and wiſdom, ſhe wholly bends the ſame againſt every beloved appearance of God, by perſecution and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: This is the woman upon the Scarlet coloured beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy.</p>

But if a man take Tythes as a Tribute and portion of the earth, which the Lord hath reſerved and given to him to nouriſh himſelf and his family, and the Church of God (for a Miniſter muſt be Hoſpitable) if a man take Tythes, though it be for preaching and his waiting upon the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, to declare what he hath ſeen and heard of God, aiming onely at the advancement of the Kingdome of Chriſt in the hearts of the people, and take onely for his livelihood in the fleſh, this man is no Antichriſt that denies Chriſts coming in the fleſh; for the Goſpel holds clearly forth a maintenance and double honour due to the preachers of it: And if but a tenth of old, were to be given for the nouriſhing of them that hold forth the ſhadow, ſurely not a tenth onely, but much more ought to be given for the nouriſhing of them that hold forth the ſubſtance. And whereas it may be ſaid that Miniſters preach up themſelves, and ſhadows ſtill, not Chriſt the Lord, and themſelves the peoples ſervants for Chriſts ſake, and many thruſt themſelves into the office of the Miniſtery for a piece of bread, and take unto themſelves this honour before they are called of God, for filthy lucres ſake: I anſwer, thoſe that are found in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, I know there is a ſad viall of wrath to be poured out upon them: as for mine own part, I finde all ſorts of people rayling on me, and ſpeaking all manner of evil of me, and though the pretence be Tythes, and other grievous things that their hearts have imagined; yet the truth is, 't is not my Tythes, nor infirmities; ſo much as my light and freedom and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Surely, methinkes thou mayeſt eaſily learn this leſſon from what is written, to make Chriſt the beginning of thy pure Religion, to make him the mover, the power, the principle, that firſt ſets thy heart aright in Religion: And this thou art compelled to ſay in thy confuſed reply, <hi>That hee who is come unto Christ is in the pure Religion,</hi> and ſo art judged out of thine own mouth to ſpeak contrary unto thy own light: And though thou wouldeſt infer from the Apoſtles words, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. That there is a light which ſhines in the creature before Chriſt come, yet that light thou art faine to acknowledge doth proceed from the Son, and lead unto him: ſo that Chriſt is ſtill the Fountain, and firſt cauſe of light: and by the light of Chriſt within we come to ſee, and know, that the Scriptures are the ſure Word of God, and ſo we are led into the pure Religion, according to what is written in the Scriptures of truth: and the end of this Scripture is again to turn us unto Chriſt, who is the ſpirit and truth of the Scriptures; and ſo Chriſt is ſtill the firſt and laſt in all the diſcoveries we have of God: he is all the light we have, by night and day: and though the Scriptures are a precious light, yet all the light that is in them is but borrowed from the Son: and if we ſee them not, know them not in his light, and through his light, they may ſhine long enough before the day will break in our hearts; but when Chriſt leads us into the meaning of Scriptures, and brings us to live in the power and truth of them, which is himſelf; then by degrees it becomes day with us, and this day ſtill leads us into the pure Religion, according to what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within, and without; and when we wander in the leaſt, is as a voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde us, ſaying, this is the way, walke in it, this is the old way: And this

And ſo to ſum up this, know. 1. That ye cannot know the meaning of the Scriptures without Chriſt: 2. Ye cannot live the life of the Scriptures, without Chriſt lead ye into it: 3. Ye cannot be in the pure Religion, without Chriſt firſt work it, and bring it into being, and light in the heart: 4. Ye cannot be in the volume of the book in a clear reading of what is written, much leſſe in the life and body of the book, which is Chriſt, the ſubſtance, without Chriſt himſelf mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in you: And ſo thou, who ſeemeſt to be Religious, learn to bridle thine own tongue, otherwiſe thou doeſt but deceive thine own heart, and all thy Religion is vaine: and learn to know thine own light, who, in thine anſwer to my ten queries about the light that is in heathens, and the light that is peculiar to the Saints of God, ſayeſt, that the light of Chriſt is the only guide to them that follow it, and beſides it, there is no guide to Jew, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile: And ſo if this light of Chriſt be the onely guide; ſurely it muſt be the onely guide into all pure Religion, and ſo the firſt principle of that which is pure: And thou, who crieſt out, O ſhame, art judged out of thine own mouth to be ſhameleſſe &amp; impudent, in ſcoffing at the firſt principle of pure Religion to be the Son of God dwelling in us.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47261:14"/> be ſubject to his Fathers will? Not to be his own, but his Fathers: I came not to do my own will, but the will of him, who ſent me. But what was the work of God which Chriſt had to do? Anſwer, It lay in two things: 1. To bear our griefs, and carry our ſorrows, to be ſmitten, wounded, and grieved for our iniquities, to bear our ſin, and all the ſorrow, grief, and Hell, due unto us for them. 2. His work was likewiſe to make reconciliation, and peace manifeſt unto the World, and to work mens hearts into a belief of what he hath done and wrought for them to bring about their deliverance and ſalvation: Wert thou rightly acquainted with this work, and the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and lowlineſſe of the perſon, who wrought it, thou wouldſt ſoon ſee this to be a great yoke and taske to come under, and do: But this is Hiſtory; and to ſhew thy ſelf wiſe, this is trampled under thy feet, and of no account with thee, and ſo thou denieſt the Lord that bought thee; and in thy dark fancie leapeſt into the myſtery, and ſayeſt, <hi>I ſee not that which turns the creature into the work and will of God:</hi> Here thou art upon the light within, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

His ſufferings in us, during the time of our ſtay in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> all which is the time of our ignorance and darkneſſe, wherein we crucifie the Lord of glory; now we live, fleſh, and ſin flouriſhes, and Chriſt is as one crucified, dead, and buried unto us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It comprehends our ſufferings in the fleſh after his example, which is our witneſſing his Croſſe, and this begins when Chriſt ariſes from death to life in us, and appears reigning; Now we ſuffer and die with him, and are contented to be emptied of all our glorying in the fleſh, as Chriſt was, this is the time of our ſuffering, and of Chriſts living; And this ſuffering in our ſinfull fleſh and nature, is the happieſt day with us that ever began; For this ſuffering goes before our glory, and alwayes ends in the Crown: For if we ſuffer with him, not onely in reproaches, revilings, and perſecutions

Doth not <hi>Peter</hi> tell us, Chriſt ſuffered for us in the fleſh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. and was there not a real thing done by it? And therefore the Scriptures ſay, once he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the end of the world, to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf, once he appeared: And in another place, the way into the holieſt is by the bloud of Jeſus; not by our bloud, as if we were our own Saviours, but by the bloud of Jeſus: And Chriſt laid down his life, a ranſome for many: And we are redeemed, not with Gold and Silver, but with the precious bloud of the Son of God: Why cannot all this Doctrine be remembred, as well as thou and thee? Is not this that Croſſe of Chriſt, which is fooliſhneſſe to them that periſh, and a ſtumbling block to the wiſe <hi>Jews?</hi> And did not the Apoſtle preach through this Croſſe reconciliation to the world, and forgiveneſſe of ſins to all that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. to the end, 10. 10. Do not all theſe places ſpeak of Chriſts crucifying and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in which croſſe lies the foundation of our comfort and ſalvation? And muſt all this ſtand onely for a figure and cypher? Is thine heart ſo lifted up to deſpiſe what Chriſt hath done, and ſuffered for thee? Surely then thou haſt no lot nor portion in this matter: But <hi>all this is hiſtorie, and hath wrought in me (thou ſayeſt) we dying and ſuffering in the fleſh, and ſo I am ſtill a ſtranger to the croſſe of Chriſt:</hi> But friend, before thou judge another, judge thy ſelf, and lay thy foundation low, otherwiſe thy building will fall: Lay it in the bloud of Chriſt, otherwiſe there's no remiſſion, no ſalvation: Then deſcend into thine own heart, and ſee how Chriſt hath layen bleeding under his croſſe, how thou haſt made him to ſerve with thine iniquities, and whether this have touched thine heart to bleed with him, to ſuffer, and die with him in thy fleſh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. And conſider now, if thy pride live, thou thy ſelf, and thy will, live, then Chriſt is ſtill under his croſſe to thee, and thou canſt not bear witneſſe unto his croſſe, but if thou, even thou thy ſelf art dead, and crucified with Chriſt, then thou knoweſt his croſſe, and art conformable to him in death; and then thy ſin and fleſh will die, and thy painted holineſſe,

If thou art in the higheſt poſſeſſion of God, now thine hope is out, for that which is ſeen and enjoyed is not hoped for: But ſtay, let the light of <hi>Jeſus first</hi> enter thee into the holy place, and there make thee a Prieſt, which name thou ſo derideſt, before thou fondly conceit to be in the holieſt, and in this holy place thou wilt learn to deſpiſe thy ſelf, and all thine own righteouſneſſe: Till <hi>Job</hi> came hither, he had a great conceit of his own goodneſſe and worth; but now he abhorres himſelf, and ſo will ye: I know ye put your ſelves into a poſture of ſuffering and reviling, yet all this ye may ſuffer, not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, but in reference unto the idoll that ye have made, and ſo not for Chriſt, but for your ſelves: And ſurely ſo long as ſo much of thy ſelf lives, that thou muſt needs be Chriſt; not with him, or in him, but he himſelf; all this while thou doſt not ſuffer thy ſelf to come under the Croſſe of Chriſt: Further, know friend what it means to be ſaved by hope, to hope for that we ſee not, and ſo with patience to wait for it: Ye know <hi>Pauls</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, and he cries out, if in this life onely wee have hope in him, we are of all men moſt miſerable; therefore wait the day and time of your diſſolution, Read, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>to</hi> 10. The life of hope is a ſweet life, ſeeing the grace came from heaven, looks back into heaven, and never leaves groaning and longing, till it return into the boſom of the Father, and the earthly houſe be changed into the heavenly: Therefore be not over-haſty: thou knoweſt the men, that would enter in without God, were ſlain, therefore be not high-minded, but fear: It's a ſad thing to be undone by our own works, undone by Religion, obſervation, abſtinence, as many an Hermit, Monk, and man hath been: Be as holy as thou wilt in the holy place, in Chriſt, onely glory not in thy formall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Thou dreameſt thou art Chriſt, and in the holieſt, and yet all can ſee thee in weakneſſe, darkneſſe, and in infirmities like other men: But I would not break thy neck, but rebuke thee with patience, though all this will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thee to ſcorn, and to turn again and rent me: And therefore I'le let thee alone to be diſcovered by the light, and day of God.</p>

If I am not as I long to be, yet I ſee the bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth me from all my ſin, the Croſſe of Chriſt makes me not to ſpare my ſelf, or ſin: I have Jeſus, who was dead but is alive, in me making void all my glorying in fleſh and bloud; and he is bearing witneſſe to my Crucifying, and to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection which is my glory: And though thou a man charge me with folly, yet he the true God declares me juſt in himſelf, and he goes on Conquering and to Conquer, and what he ſees amiſſe in me, he will tame, ſubdue, and bring under, and tell thee to thy face, thou art a Satan, is not this a brand plucked out of the fire: Therefore friend do not thou fanſie a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Croſſe, and yet remain a ſtranger to the Croſſe, by living out of the vertue and power of it, which makes all fleſh as graſſe, and to wither as the flower of the field: It is Chriſt in me that is my glory, and his life in me ſprings out of his death and mine, and makes void all my glory, and he by his bloud and power ſets me free from the condemnation of ſin, and the Law, and he keeps me alwayes in his eye, and he ſearches my errours and failings out, to nail them to his Croſſe. As for that place thou quoteſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. look upon it better, and take the tenth verſe too in thy minde, and ſee
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47261:27"/> how thou canſt have ſin and no ſin, for ſo the Apoſtle ſaith plainly, in all the Saints there's no ſin, and yet there's ſin in all, otherwiſe we make God a lyar, and his word is not in us: Neither is this to plead for ſin, as thou ſayeſt; for there's a vaſt difference between ſaying ſuch a thing is, and ſuch a thing out to be: That the Saints have ſin is a truth written in Scripture, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans conſcience; for there is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good and ſins not: But that the Saints ought to have ſin, this the Scripture cries ought againſt, and calls upon us to purge out more and more: therefore be not alwayes catching and ſnarling; this is not a Chriſtian practice: but let thy ſin go, thy exalting of thy ſelf go, and it may be thou mayeſt finde out the Croſſe of Chriſt a little more exactly yet, and learn better what it is to be Crucified with him, and ſo mayeſt eat of his fleſh, and drink of his bloud.

As for the flowing of the ſalt Sea, whence the beaſt ariſes with ſeven heads, this I have ſeen according to my meaſure dried up, and the beaſt with ſeven heads withering for want of his native heat and moiſture in me: And friend, I beſeech thee, read the meaning of this at home in thy ſelf: read the bitterneſſe in thy ſelf, the evil eye, that envies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is good, the folly and haughtineſſe of thine own heart: Here is the ſalt Sea in which thou art drowned, though thou ſee it not, and out of this Sea comes that Monſter with ſeven heads, which deſtroyes ſome with flatteries, others with violence and rage, aiming at his own Kingdom and greatneſſe, whoever periſh with him: this beaſt lies covered under all thine Hypocriſie, and thou ſeeſt him not.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I have done in the dayes of mine unbelief, when I conſulted with fleſh and bloud: But ſince the day of the Lord hath begun to dawn in my ſpirit, truth hath been my companion; I have ventured all for her, and laid my ſelf open to the violence of all ſorts of men for the truths ſake: And that I have ſuffered no more than I have, conſidering the malice of carnal men, and formal men; this I look upon as a notable paſſage of wiſdom and providence in God: Further, know that this truth in me, which hath in ſome meaſure acquainted me with the will and nature of God, my Saviour, this teacheth me to plead againſt the errours and evils, and blaſphemies, and idols of all, not againſt any truth I ſee in my meaneſt brethren: Neither am I with my Horns puſhing againſt the Lamb; no, the Lamb is my well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, he ſhall lye all night betwixt my breaſts; he is my fair one; when he withdraws, my Soul faints; when he appears, my Soul lives, and is exceeding merry. This is he whom I can own in all the Sons of God, even in thoſe who cannot own the Lamb in me: In all this he is my witneſſe, though thou know it not. But thou ſayeſt:</p>

Surely this gave me my Tyth of two Pariſhes; and this wronged none, when it gave me Tythe; and this providence maintains Tythes for my uſe, and tells me, I wrong none, whilſt I take it with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not with oppreſſion and rigour: And this is that, even providence, thou haſt murmured againſt in this buſineſſe of Tythes; And thou ſhalt know to thy ſorrow, that God hath heard thy murmurings againſt himſelf, and will bring thee to a due account for them: For who are wee? Your murmurings are not ſo much againſt us, as againſt the Lord: and that which he gives us, ye have prophanely called the wages of unrighteouſneſſe: And therefore he will ſtop the mouth of the evill beaſt in thee.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47261:33"/> ſpirit of God, I own it as a witneſſe and Declaration of the Lords will and mind to man: This I profeſſe not out of the life and light of the ſpirit, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that that is the living word, the kernel, the ſubſtance, which quickens all the body, and knits the Saints altogether in that one peace of God: And this ſpirit declared in the Letter, is that which keeps me from vanity, and frees me from the Law of ſin, death, and condemnation.</p>
               <p>And now to the buſineſſe of Tythes: Thou ſayes:</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>In my corrupt reaſon I am ſcraping up reaſons to maintain Tythes, but ſhew no Scripture.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here thou art at thine old trade, prating and ſlighting, but ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little reaſon, and yet thou goeſt on to teach, and ſay:</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And why muſt not the Miniſters of the Goſpel have maintenance too for their ſervice? Doth the Goſpel afford leſſe than the Law? But to let that paſſe: Thou haſt ſpoken a piece of truth, to which I add: Thou mayeſt finde even <hi>Levi</hi> himſelf paid Tythes in <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 7. 9. and ſo Tythes were paid before the Law, and <hi>Levi</hi> were in being, as to the Letter: ſo that the payment of Tythes extended further than to the litteral Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> And if <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> payed Tythes, as it appears they did, before the Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18, 19, 20. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 22. ſurely they did it by a light within, and this light was their Law; and this is thine too ſometimes, though very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, eſpecially when to part with ſomething from thy ſelf; and therefore art thou covetous to rob others of all their glory in inward things, to advance thy ſelf; and of their property too in outward things, and ſo thou art greedy to keep the tenth of all. But to proceed:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Thou ſayeſt, <hi>When Chriſt came, he put an end to that ſervice, and to the wages due to that ſervice, and that he continued Tythes to the Miniſters of the Goſpel by a Law, that thou bid'ſt me prove by Scripture command, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Chriſt put an end to the Levitical prieſt-hood, that I deny not: But that Chriſt put an end to the prieſt-hood ſo, as to ſet up no teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the room thereof, that I deny: But what, or who hath he ſet up? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Miniſters not of the Letter, but of the ſpirit. But are your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſuch? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> thoſe whom Chriſt anoints and ordains are ſuch: for the reſt I plead not: But where have you Miniſters that are ſuch, if the thing ſhould be granted, any command, example, or practice for Tythes? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> we have the light within written in the hearts of all Nations, which teacheth them to pay Tythes, or maintenance unto their Prieſts at this day; this is the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47261:34"/> light of our Nation to pay Tythe unto their Miniſters: And this is of as much force ſtill, where it guides and rules, to teach men what to do, as it was of old before there was a Law for either prieſt hood, or Tythes: But doth this light teach men to pay Tythes? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It doth ſo, it teacheth men to pay Tythes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or maintenance unto their Miniſters; and where this light rules not, there the Miniſters can get no maintenance without an outward Law, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he come in the anointing of the Lords ſpirit: A Prieſt of <hi>Baal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may get Tythe, or maintenance without a Law; but a Miniſter of the Goſpell can get none without a Law: and ſo in pleading againſt Tythe, or maintenance for men anointed by Chriſt to preach, thou declareſt thy ſelf a friend of <hi>Baal</hi> and his Prieſts: For doeſt thou not ſee how all Sects and forms in the Nation, that are ſeparated from the Miniſtery are almoſt all ſo farre blinded in this matter, as to joyne with unbelievers, worldlings, and coveteous wretches to keep their Tythes, eſpecially if the Miniſter be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed and called of God? But where is your light within for Tythes gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Scripture? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> look, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6, 7. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>to</hi> 13. And remember what Chriſt ſaith, the labourer is worthy of his hire: And he that labours, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> in word and Doctrine is worthy of double honour: nay it is a hard thing to pleaſe Chriſt, who hath called us to be Souldiers, when we muſt labour, and be intangled with the affaires of this life for a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: And who goes to warfare of his own charges? That which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have I could deſire might be with leſſe trouble and care: However take all theſe Scriptures, and ſee whether there be no maintenance or Tythe due to Goſpell-Miniſters.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt ſaid, freely ye have received, freely give: <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Chriſt in that teacheth us to doe the Lords worke willingly, not by conſtraint, or for filthy lucre; but of a ready minde, to be as free to communicate and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the heavenly Treaſure, as he is to beſtow it on us, not aiming at our ſelves and gain, but at the advancement of his Kingdom and Goſpell in the hearts of men: And this the Miniſters of Chriſt are deſirous to do through his grace. But into whatſoever houſe ye enter, eat ſuch things as are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> And ſo we will, when we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to journey up and down the world as the Diſciples were to do; but being ordained over a particular place, we are to feed the people with the word, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made us Overſeers, and to take ſuch things as are conſecrated to us.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt bid the Apoſtles take no Tythes: <hi>Anſwer,</hi> And ſtrange it is he ſhould, ſeeing they were to go up and down from City to City, and place to place: Surely, if they had taken Tythes of all, they would have been very rich:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47261:34"/> And beſides, the world being ſtrangers to all knowledge and profeſſion of Chriſt, this would have hindered the advance of the Goſpell: Yet <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they might be chargeable to them, as other Apoſtles of Chriſt: And yet thou goeſt on, to ſay:</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>O ſhame of all Pariſh hirelings, who have a Law to force maintenance from an whole Pariſh, and I who call my ſelf a Miniſter of the Goſpell, am not content with the Goſpell wages, and thou bid'ſt me prove, if ever Miniſter of the Goſpell pleaded for</hi> Leviticall <hi>wages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No friend, this I go not about to prove; but maintenance is the thing I prove, and if thou call that <hi>Leviticall,</hi> thou mayeſt, thy tongue is thine own: Neither would I plead for any thing, if all did covet to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light within and without, which teacheth that the labourer is worthy of his hire.</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>But Chriſt blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances,</hi> Heb. 7. 10. Col. 2. 20. <hi>And ſo I that am ſubject to theſe things am in the world and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But ſee whether thou thy ſelf be not rather in the coveteous practices of the moſt wicked of the world, in ſeeking to keep thy Tythes from the labourer; who, Chriſt ſaith, is worthy of his hire: mark that word hire; It may be, it may open thine eyes, though hirelings in thy account I know the Lord abhorres, who labour for themſelves, not the Lord: Yet take heed how thou keepeſt the hire from the true labourer, and that againſt all light and Law, and this preſent Scripture, in that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>The Law of the Prieſt-hood is changed;</hi> And ſo ſay I, and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20. We muſt not be ſubject to ceremoniall ordinances, as touch not, taſt not, handle not, ſeeing what was ceremoniall God hath blotted out, and nailed to the Croſſe of Chriſt; and ſo we are not to place Religion and holineſſe and worſhip in outward things, and places and Ceremonies, but may be free to that which the Law made outwardly unclean, as touch not, taſte not: And yet in this freedom we are not to be without Law to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> But ſtill thou goeſt on to tell me, <hi>I am a Thiefe, and talkeſt of the wages of the firſt Prieſt-hood, which God did not allot to them, who were to do the work of the everlaſting Priest-hood.</hi>

That I teach for gain is but thy ſimple prate: I am contented with what I have, Tythes, or no Tythes, if the Lord pleaſe: God is my wages, and he payes me well. Further thou ſayeſt:</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>I plead for Tythes, ſometimes as a gift from the Magiſtrate, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as a gift from the Lord; and ſo thou curſeſt me from running greedily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the errour of</hi> Balaam <hi>for gifts and rewards, and my God thou denieſt, who teacheth me to plead for gifts.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God and the Magiſtrate are one in work; that which the Lord gives, he leaves to the Magiſtrate to give under him; and that which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate diſpoſes of, confirms, maintains, and gives in outward things, that is of the Lord, or according to the wiſdom and providing of God, who hath the heart of the Magiſtrate in his hand, and turnes it which way he pleaſeth; ſo that the Magiſtrate, as a figure of God, is to imitate God in Juſtice and righteouſneſſe, to look to the Lord, and obſerve his carriage, and heed his minde and will, and to carry himſelf as the Lord doth towards men, in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, juſtice and righteouſneſſe, ſeeking to maintain peace, liberty, freedom, property in this unruly world: and ſo Tythes being a peculiar property, which the wiſdom of God hath directed the Magiſtrate to diſpoſe of, partly to the Miniſters, partly to others; when the Magiſtrate doth this, God doth it, which the envious one cannot ſee, but cries out blaſphemy: And no wonder, though ye deny the lawfulneſſe of this Act of the Magiſtrate, who is but the Lords Steward, ſeeing ye deny the Maſter of the houſe, and would be wiſer than Chriſt, or man, to have all at your diſpoſing. As for gifts, or rewards out of the will of God, I deſire them not: I know he is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want; and though thou pray for nothing from him, it ſeems as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47261:35"/> though thou ſtoodſt in no need of his bread, gifts, and providence, yet be ſure if God ſhould withdraw his gifts and favours never ſo little, thy ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, beauty, ſtrength, life, body and ſpirit too, would ſoon mourn, languiſh, and wither away for want of the Lords mercies.</p>

Further, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of uſing the world, as if we uſed it not; ſo that the Goſpel is rather againſt all property, than commands any at all: And yet the Saints of God ſurely may have poſſeſſions in the world; but the Goſpel no where commands, or forbids this, or that in outward things; onely we ought to ſit looſe to the world, to all things as well as ſome, and in what ſtate we are in, therewith to be content: And when you are in this frame, your hearts will be levelled more than they are to all outward things, and you'l plainly ſee, that God hath forbidden rent, as much as he hath forbidden Tythes: And if you have any command for your rent, or any other property, ſhew it, and I will ſhew you the ſame command is as much for Tythes; and if God hath put an end to Tythes, he hath put the ſame end to rent, and hath taught us all in the midſt of all outward things to be as having nothing, and yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all things. But thou ſayeſt:</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>God gave not Tythes to his Diſciples and Apoſtles, who laboured pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Word &amp; Doctrine, and ſo ſurely he hath given it to ſwarm of locuſts, who live in ungodlineſſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But what if the Lay-man, as they are called, take Tythes, muſt he be a <hi>Judas,</hi> a Thief, an Hireling too, becauſe he takes his property of Tythes where it is, and from others, who have laboured to till the ground for him? But yet this man, who doth nothing for his Tythes, and yet takes it, as due by Law, is not cried out upon uſually; onely the Miniſter is reviled for Tythes, or maintenance, though he labour and take pains diligently in the Office, and place he is called unto. But why doeſt thou ſpeak of <hi>Judas?</hi> Did <hi>Judas</hi> take Tythes? And fill his bag with Tythes, that Miniſters are like <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> in their Tythes? By this thou wilt unawares give us an argument for Tythes: But the <hi>Judas</hi> and his bag take unto thy ſelf, who wandereſt up and down to ſell thy Maſter for a piece of bread, and betrayeſt his Goſpel, truth and bloud into the hands of ſinners, to get thy ſelf a name and fame in the world: And therefore thou biddeſt all others ſtand by, <hi>I am holier and wiſer than thou, thou art a Traitor, a</hi> Judas, <hi>a Thief, and ſinner: But I have no ſin, I am a Prophet, Apoſtle, Miniſter of the Goſpel; Nay, I am Christ, the Lord, who am come to judge the world:</hi> And ſo with thy light wanton Spirit, which runs a whoring after thy fleſh and ſelf, thou allureſt with ſwelling words of vanity thoſe who were eſcaped from them who live in errour, again to come and live in errour: And ſo taking no notice of thine own pride, doing all to be ſeen of men, and praiſed of men, and accounted a Chriſt and God, though a dark enemy to God and Chriſt, I ſay, taking no notice of thine own pride, thou crieſt out againſt others for cuffs, gaudineſſe, rings-hoods, vails, which Chriſt forbad, thou ſayeſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. And friend, where thou ſeeſt theſe things uſed without modeſty, ſhamefacedneſſe and ſobrietie, which becomes women profeſſing godlineſſe, there thou mayeſt vaunt, and cry out aloud in thy boaſting ſpirit, that thou art not like other women, and as the Prieſt of <hi>England</hi> are in outward pride, though inwardly thou exceedeſt them all: But to end this prattle of <hi>Judas</hi> and women, thou ſayeſt, a Miniſter muſt be Hoſpitable: but how, and with what thou knoweſt not, give he muſt; but wherewith to give he muſt not have: All Tythes, maintenance, ſet wages, gifts, that's Antichriſtian: All rewards, either from God, or men, that's <hi>Balaam-like,</hi> as thy wiſdom calls it, and yet the man muſt be Hoſpitable:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47261:36"/> 
                  <hi>But let him preach, and truſt God for maintenance:</hi> And ſo ſay I too; Let Miniſters preach the Goſpell, be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, beſeech men to be reconciled to God, not to this, or that form, cuſtom, tradition, or outward ſocietie, but onely in the will of God unto God, and the truth of God, and the people of God in all fellowſhips ſcattered up and down the world: Let Miniſters do their duty, and truſt God for their maintenance, who in the midſt of all the peoples murmurings againſt this grievous burden of Tythes, doth ſtill make proviſion for his Miniſters in the Nation: God, who takes care for Oxen, takes care for thoſe who tread out the Corn, who break the ſhell, and diſpenſe out the word aright unto the people, though the envious hard-hearted world every where repine and murmure at this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which the Lord makes.</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>But this, thou ſayeſt, both is a taking of that which another hath pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laboured for.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And yet this by wiſe men is looked upon as no oppreſſion, Tythes being a peculiar property, that no man can call his own, but he to whom the providence of God, and the wiſdom of the Nation hath given them; and though it be out of anothers labours, yet all Rent, Cuſtomes, Taxes, Uſe, are the ſame, payes out of other mens ventures, labours, paines, and yet the taking of them looked upon as no ſuch grievous oppreſſion and ſin, as the taking of Tythes, though with much moderation by a Miniſter: But thou ſayeſt,</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>Let the priſons in</hi> England <hi>judge of the Prieſts Hoſpitalitie, who caſt the Saints into priſon, ſome priſons have five, ſome ten, twenty, twenty four of the Children of God in them.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I own not, the putting Saints in priſon, eſpecially if it be for conſcience towards God: thoſe who are guilty of this, have a ſad account to make: But yet it is not the ſuffering, but the cauſe, that makes the martyr: A man may ſuffer much, endure much hardſhip, grief, bonds; yea, and death too, and yet not ſuffer as a Chriſtian with Chriſt, nor for his ſake: and if any ſuffer thus, what glory is it? For a man may ſuffer as a Murderer, as a Thief, as an evill doer, as a buſie body: and that many thus ſuffer, it's apparent: And ſo it behoves you to be well adviſed for what ye ſuffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye glory too much of your ſufferings as Saints. But thou comeſt to tell me, to whom my Hoſpitality reaches.</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>First to mine own back and belly, who live in exceſſe, and ſcorn ſuch as do not; then to feaſt Drunkards, Ranters, and prophane perſons, and to ſpend the time in laughter, mirth, folly, vanity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All this is but the deviſe and viſion of a Quakers ſpirit; as for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47261:37"/> fine cloathes, and feaſts, and carnall merriments, I have ſeen vanity and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them, and can be as well content without them as the ſtricteſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: Neither hath any company, or people at any feaſt, or meeting been ſo welcom to me as the Son of God: As for Ranters and Atheiſts, and men that under a conceit of being above ordinances, Miniſters, and all worſhip of God, have loſt all Religion and appearances of grace, take all thoſe to thy ſelf; for theſe uſually are the people that go to the making up of thy fooliſh building. Further thou telleſt me:</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>My moderation, freedom, and enlargement in matters of Tythes will not colour over my deceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet all thy railing, lying, &amp; envy ſhall not make me forget my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and freedom in this matter, or make me guilty of that deceit, pride, fulneſſe, exceſſe, vanity, thou layeſt unto my charge: Neither ſhall all thy fury againſt the Prieſt-hood provoke me to plead for any of the carnall falſe Prieſt-hood, who preach for lucre, gifts and rewards, or the like. All that I aime at in pleading for the Miniſtery is this, to make this out in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and I know it is evident there already, that God hath ſtill a precious ſeed in the Miniſtery: that in our age, and ages before, there have been, and ſtill are ſome in the Miniſtery, that have been, and are precious lights unto the Saints of God; men that have ſtood up boldly againſt the idolatries, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, inventions, and ſins of the Nation in their time, according unto their meaſure of grace: Theſe are men whoſe weakneſſes the Lord covers, and whoſe ſpirits he ſtill keeps up to commend the truth to every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſight of God: Theſe I have ſeen a ſtrong Angell protecting and providing for; and all the Miniſtery fare the better for their ſakes: Theſe are men whom the Father pleads for: And though I finde too much folly &amp; ſelfiſhnes in the beſt of us all; yet look upon any form, or way in the Nation, and there you may finde the ſame, and ſee we have all cauſe to put on patience, meekneſſe, brotherly kindneſſe, charity, to be ſubject one to another in love, and to walk humbly and meekly with our God.</p>
               <p>And though ye are a people that are riſen up above all and pretend to a light that is infallible in every particular, and to an eſtate free from all remnants of ſinne, yet I know, and am perſwaded by the Lord, that both the light within, and the light of Scripture makes it out plain to your conſcience, that in many things ye are dark, ignorant, doubtfull, ſelfiſh, high-minded, carnall, and ſo walk as other men: And though I know you'l ſay, the new man ſins not, and ye are dead indeed unto ſin, and the bloud of Chriſt, &amp; grace of Chriſt have purged away all our unrighteouſneſſe, and we are as God is, and as Chriſt is in this preſent world: All theſe and the like I know are high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47261:37"/> of the Saints freedom, dignity, and honour, yet they never make uſe of theſe and the like Scriptures to any other end, or purpoſe, than to ſet forth what they were in Gods account, grace, and favourable acceptation; and to comfort and encourage one another in the midſt of all their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities with the new birth, the new man, the work of God upon the heart within, in which is all the fulneſſe, and happineſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe of a Chriſtian in this world: This is the uſe they made of ſuch Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to highten the grace of God; and to further their glorying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations in the Lord: And yet in their fleſh, they ſaw no good thing, and in themſelves they were conſcious of errours and ſins enough to be humbled for, whilſt in this body of clay: as we ſee in <hi>Job, David, Paul,</hi> and others of the precious ones of God. And ſo to ſpeak a word to thee: Remember from whence thou art fallen; thou art fallen from thy light within; thou haſt loſt thy tenderneſſe to the Saints of God, becauſe thy light within is turned into utter darkneſſe: and now in the deep darkneſſe thou art high in thine own imaginations: Nay, thou art, <hi>I am, and theres none beſides thee;</hi> and ſo thou rageſt and art furious againſt every one that ſees thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and blaſphemie. Why, poor vile worm, where art thou? and what art thou? Thou art like the <hi>Egyptians</hi> fleſh, and not ſpirit; thou art a man, and the ſon of man that ſhall die, a man full of infirmities and ſins, like all others of the ſons of men; Nay, a man of ſin in all thy proud exaltings of thy ſelf; a lyar, a falſe Prophet thou art, who crieſt out, <hi>I am Chriſt,</hi> the ſon of the moſt high; lo here, lo here: In all this haſt thou grieved the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, ſinned away the promiſe of the Father, made uſe of the light within to wreſt the Scriptures to thine own deſtruction: which light teacheth thee to fear the Lord alwayes for thy good, to glory and triumph in him, as in thy life and joy: This light reproves thy drunken ſpirit, thy wanton heart, that is ſo farre in love with thy proud fleſh, that thou muſt needs be Chriſt and God: This reproves thy ſcoffing jeering nature, thy ſeeking to deſtroy the weak ones for whom Chriſt died: This light ſhines in thy darneſſe, but thou comprehendeſt it not: and this tells thee to thy face, thou art igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, bruitiſh, fooliſh, and knoweſt little of the myſteries of God and Chriſt, and what thou knoweſt doth but puffe thee up, and make thee forget thy Maker; and yet loath thou art to be ſeen and made manifeſt to thy deluded party; and therefore thou hateſt the light of Chriſt and Goſpell of grace, and unwilling thou art to come to the light, leſt thy deeds ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: and though thou talke of being redeemed from the earth, yet thou knoweſt not the earth wherein thou dwelleſt; thou canſt not ſee the earth in thine heart ſet, nor how thou thy ſelf art the earth wherein thou liveſt:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47261:38"/> And here thou art rich, and wiſe, and honourable in this earth of fleſh and bloud, and knoweſt not that this earth muſt paſſe away, and all the works that are therein be burnt up and conſumed, becauſe that in it dwells no good thing: Therefore thou proud wretch that art lifted up to heaven, come down from thy Throne, and ſee thy ſhame, ſee where thou liveſt, even where Satans ſeat is, in that which is called the the old man, the Serpent, Satan, the accuſer: This is thy nature, thy ſeat, and habitation where thou dwelleſt: And up and down the World thou goeſt like thy Father to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the noble ſeed of God, that thou alone mayeſt be the ſeed, the King, the God and all: Therefore be wiſe for thy ſelf, look home, turn thine eyes inward; be not alwayes like the fool abroad: Thou haſt a great work yet to do; Nay, all thy work yet to beginne, which is to deny thy ſelf: Thou haſt almoſt all the weakneſſes, blemiſhes, errours, ſins of all the forms abroad centred in thy ſelf, and therefore lay the Ax to the root of the Tree, hew down thy ſelf, or rather let the Lord do it for thee; he is wiſer and ſtronger than thy ſelf, he'l ſearch, and prove, and try what wickedneſſe there is in thee, and lead thee in the way everlaſting: Know in all this, I am not thine enemie; mine aime is at the deſtruction of Antichriſt, and the man of ſin in thee; and fain I would ſee thee what thou pretendeſt to be, holy, harmeleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners according to ſome meaſure of Chriſt, learning to ſee the Father in the face of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and then thou wilt ſoon fall down at his feet, and ſay, <hi>I am a man, a poore drop of the bucket, one who cannot in all my ſearch finde out the Almightie in his perfection; he is high, and deep, and incomprehenſible, but I am vanity, a weak, poor, ſhallow thing, and ſo I cannot but in admiration of the Lord, wiſdom, and knowledge ſay, How unſearchable are his judgements and his wayes paſt finding out: Who hath known the minde of the Lord, or been his Counſellour? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things; to whom be glory for ever and ever.</hi>

               <p>Further, Chriſt created all things, all things were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him was nothing made, that was made; and Chriſt preſerves all things, by him all things conſiſt, and he upholds all by the word of his power, where's the man that can appropriate this power unto himſelf? haſt thou an arm like God? canſt thou make a new body, or quicken an image with a Soul, and make life appear? canſt thou retain the ſpirit of man, or beaſt, when the Lord commands it away? I know there are that will attempt miracles, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but all vaniſhes ſtill, nothing is for ever, but what the Lord do's, let this teach us to fear before him, knowing that 't is he, who made us, and not we our ſelves, we are his off-ſpring, and by him we have life and motion, and all things.</p>
               <p>Further, Yet Chriſt was the onely begotten ſon of God, the firſt-born, his ſon by nature, begotten by his power, and brought forth by a Virgin; but we are the ſons of God by grace, if we ſpeak of the Saints, nature do's not make us ſons, but the new birth, the regeneration, without which there's no entring into the Kingdom of God.</p>

               <p> Further, Chriſt he's the husband, we the ſpouſe, and though the husband and wife be one, yet the head of the woman is the man, I ſpeak of Chriſt and his Church, he's the man, the root, the head ſtill; and he's the King, we the ſubjects; he the vine, we the branches; he's the Lord and Maſter, we the ſervants; he's the fountain, we the ſtreams; he's the father, we the ſons; he's all in all, we are nothing; in all this I hope I do not leſſen the glory of Chriſt, the Lord, nor of his Church, his Saints; neither do I ſad the Souls of any, but ſuch as are lifted up to forget their Saviour; therefore come away friends, glory as much as you will and can in your greatneſſe, and glory; there is a likeneſſe between Chriſt and Saints, that they be filled with joy, and reſt, and abundance of conſolation: yet withall, there's an unlikeneſſe to; Chriſt is infinitely more above us all, than all the men in the world above the loweſt creature, therefore away, away with ſomethingneſſe, ſelf-glorying, this is enough for the world to be proud, and high-minded; but let all the Lords people be content to loſe their lives, themſelves, their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, gifts, Crowns, throw all down at the feet of the Lambe; ſaying, thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created; and thou high big fleſh that ſayeſt thou art as Chriſt in this preſent world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt darkneſſe, the leaſt ſin; when, thou knoweſt not the ground, why he was, and could not but be without ſin; and no man ſo as he, whileſt in this houſe of clay; he was a man ſingular in his generation, who is able to declare it; he was the Virgins ſon, without the knowledge of a man; he was the word made fleſh, even that word of promiſe, which was made to <hi>Adam,</hi> came and figured, and brought forth it ſelf in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, or in the form of man, out of a woman, without the leaſt influence of man: Thou ſhalt conceive, ſayes the Angel, in thy womb, and bring forth a ſon, &amp; call his name Jeſus, he ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the ſon of the higheſt. How can this be, ſayes <hi>Marie,</hi> ſeeing I know not a man? Then anſwered the Angel, the holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, &amp; the power of the higheſt ſhall over ſhadow thee; therefore that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the ſon of God, here was an holy Childe, a Childe begotten, formed, brought forth meerly by the finger of God. Here was no tincture touch, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of man in this birth, &amp; therfore called the Son of God, the holy thing, holy fleſh, pure fleſh, like the fleſh of <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; nay, more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, a body deſcended from God, &amp; a body filled with God or God cloathed with the veil of a mans body, &amp; hence there was nothing in this man but God, therefore called <hi>Emanuel;</hi> hence there could be no earthly ſinfull minde, and will begotten in and with that man; no, he was wholly wrapped up in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47261:53"/> the Deity, in the will of the Father; and ſo the Serpent could have no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, becauſe no earthlineſſe in him to work upon; tempt him he might, but prevail be could not, becauſe he was not an earthly ſeed, but an heavenly, and ſo made in the likeneſſe of a ſinner, yet he knew no ſin, he never fed upon that Tree, but the will of his Father was his food; hence he's called holy, undefiled, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from heaven, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual heavenly man; ſo he was in that man <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo he is in all the Saints of God an heavenly man, a new man, begotten by the power of the moſt high, and ſo is in us that new birth, which cannot commit ſin. But as for thy body, and the bodies of all men in the world, we are far beneath Chriſt in our generation, being men, begotten of earthly ſeed, in the luſt and weakneſſe, and darkneſſe of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> fallen; hence after his fall he's ſaid to beget a ſon in his own likeneſſe, after his image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 3. Not after the likeneſſe of God, that could not be, ſince he was fallen from God, but after his own likeneſſe, his own nature, which was now fallen to the earth; ſuch as the father was, ſuch the ſon muſt be, fleſhly, earthly; hence it comes to paſſe, that mans, as he growes up, naturally, enclines to the creatures, luſteth and longeth after the world, and ſo the ſpirit of his Soul, his minde and will becomes infected with the earth and fleſh, and ſo he longs after the earthly fruit, and being darkned and eſtranged from the life of God, through his carnall longing, hence he alwayes enclines to himſelf, to the woman the weaker part, and ſo hearkens to the voice of fleſh, and goes away from God; and here he commits iniquity with greedineſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 17, 18. and ſo the foundation of ſin is laid in mans generation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me; and ſo the fleſh is ſins free-hold, where he rules and dwels as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 18. I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh dwell's no good thing; I do not take the fleſh for the body onely, for that without the Soul is a dead thing, and knows neither good nor evill; but for the whole firſt man, or the man-hood made up of body, and Soul, this man as ſoon as he is born goes aſtray, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 3. He looks to the earth, and ſo his minde and will becomes infected, he covets, and he luſts in the dark, and has not; he's angry, and fain he would be alone; he feeds upon the outbirth, with is like himſelf, and all to nouriſh himſelf, and ſtrengthen himſelf, and be ſomething of himſelf, and yet he's faint and weary; and when the Lord comes to ſeate himſelf, or to ariſe out of the grave in him where he lies dead as it were, and to form the heavenly man by his heavenly ſeed in this earthly Tabernacle, or man-hood of ours: Ah! what renting and tearing is there before the Soul be willing to receive this new gueſt, as there muſt be a rending of the woman before the Childe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47261:54"/> is born, ſo a rending of the Soul before the man-childe be born, compared to the ſorrows of a woman in travel; and when this ſon of the virgin, this new man is born in the minde, and begins to ſhew himſelf in us, then he ſins not indeed, but the fleſh is weak, and ſins ſtill; and ſo long as the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe is, the earthly man is, and he's for himſelf, and ſo vails the heavenly in part ſtill till the earthly be quite broken by death, and hence <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, not to be Chriſt, but with Chriſt, and that not in the body, but out of the body, which ſayes, he is beſt of all, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. 24. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, to 9.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47261:54"/> that is in beaſts is below the light and life that is in men, and ſo the natural man receives not the things of the ſpirit, neither can he know them, for they are beyond his principle of light, but the ſpiritual man diſcerneth all thingh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And yet the naturall man has a light too, I call him the natural man, becauſe he's firſt, and to us more manifeſt; as the Apoſtle ſayes, that which is firſt is naturall, afterwards that which is ſpiritual; this firſt man according to his principle has a light and life, and that flows from the root Chriſt in him which he ſees not, for the head of every man is Chriſt, and in him all live, and move, and have their being; and this light or Chriſt ſhines in the darkneſſe, but the darkneſſe knows it not and ſo man has ſkill and underſtanding in things of nature, and as far as this creation teaches him, and this is his light, and the root which is Chriſt he ſees not, and ſo is ſtill in darkneſſe, as to Chriſt, &amp; the hidden things of God; now all this light, or reaſon ſets man in a ſphere above beaſts, which are therefore called irrational, man rational; and this light, through low and faint, yet teaches man to feel and groap after a God, and to worſhip, yet ſtill 't is to the unknown God: it ſhines and glimmers in the darkneſſe of the firſt man fallen, and as it came from God, ſo it returns to God, &amp; feels after him in this and that without, and wearies it ſelf about the knowledge of good and evill, and many times puts ſome faint deſires in man after God, enough to bear witneſſe of it ſelf unto man, and to leave him inexcuſable; but this light is but an imperfect, weak, faint light, as I may ſo call it, not that any thing is ſo to God; but to us 't is ſo, as vailed by our fleſhly minde, thoughts, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo it grows weaker, and weary, and in the end goes out and we ſee it no more; and ſo man in the firſt ſtate has need of a new birth, a new man, that is, ſpirit and power from God, a new fountain to break up in him, or rather to have that awakened which before lay dead, &amp; left us in darknes, man has need of this, as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> and our own experiences: this is he whom we are to wait for, the coming of Chriſt, the new man, to viſit us with light and ſalvation, and when Chriſt, and grace, and love from the father, ſprings up in us, and ſhews it ſelf to be our light and guide, then the true light is come, it was but fleſh before, but reaſon, and nature, and law now, 't is the truth, and it brings grace and truth to us, and now God is come, Chriſt is come, they were there before, but now we are awakened, and we ſee them to be there; and this coming of Chriſt in power as to <hi>Paul</hi> is the coming of light and life indeed unto our Souls, before this was revealed in <hi>Paul,</hi> he knew ſomething indeed of the Law, and the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, but he knew nothing of the Goſpel of the Tree of life, of the truth, as 't is in Jeſus, and of his own wicked falſe heart; but when Chriſt was revealed then
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47261:55"/> he leaves off fleſh and bloud, and conſults with Chriſt alone, and he makes all things manifeſt, and ſhews him what to do; and thus you ſee a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the light that is in the firſt man, and the light that is in the ſecond man; I mean the light that is in us, whileſt we are in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the light that is in us, when we come to be in the ſtate of grace; in the firſt 't is but reaſon, and it tends to the building up of man and ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 't is weak, and knows not the Lord in truth, nor the way to him, and 't is onely ſufficient to witneſſe there is a God, and ſo to condemne us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we run into ſin; but 't is not ſufficient by the higheſt improvement of it to bring us acquainted with Chriſt and ſalvation by him, as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Paul;</hi> but as for the light which ſprings up in us in us through a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or revelation of Chriſt, in &amp; to our Souls, this ſhews us the father in love, and brings us reconciled, and leads us to feed and live upon him for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and ſo is a bringing of us out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light.</p>

There's the fancie, that's the ſeat of all the innumerable thoughts, and imaginations that ſpring up in the heart of man, and this is the ſeat of all the Quakers dreams, and high thoughts of themſelves, and mean thoughts of others, and of many the precious truths of God. 8.

                  <hi>Repl. John,</hi> I know, had a Viſion of Satans binding in himſelf, and a Viſion of all the binding and looſing that was to be in ages to come, and therefore the Revelation of Jeſus in him, was to ſhew unto his ſervants things which muſt ſhortly come to paſſe; now I know about this binding and looſing of Satan, and the living and reigning with Chriſt a thouſand years, called the firſt reſurrection, there is a great variety of opinions and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt the Saints, and in the world, and all the opinions almoſt look unto things without, unto ſome intable obſervation to the outward eye abroad; making this, and that the beginning of the thouſand years, and the firſt reſurrection, ſo making the ſpiritual Kingdom to ſpring up with ſome great outward glory, and to begin with ſome obſervation viſible to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, all which methinks ſuits not with the nature of a ſpirituall King and Kingdom, and ſo ſeeing men feel after that without, which was to be fulfilled within, and hearing of the great talk of the Quakers knowledge, therefore I ſent to thee to know, and ſee thine experience of this reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of this binding Satan and reigning with Chriſt; and behold I ſee nothing in all thine anſwers but vanity, pride, and deep darkneſſe, ſo much to that anſwer; to which I'le adde, Bleſſed, and holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection, that hath Chriſt to be his reſurrection and life, by whom he's fetched out of the grave, and paſſed from death into life by a ſtrong hand; this man as he has bowed and given himſelf to Chriſt, ſo Chriſt is come down as it were to him to ſet him upon the Throne of his glory, and here he ſees judgement executed upon the beaſt and Dragon, and Satan bound in him all the dayes of his life, and Chriſt living and reigning in him for evermore, this is the firſt reſurrection, over which the ſecond death hath no power, and this is that I commend to all, as the better part which the Saints in their meaſure all injoy, and without which the laſt reſurrection will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47261:62"/> be but a ſad hour of ſorrow, and woe unto the world, and ſo though the laſt reſurrection I own, and the day of judgement, yet the firſt reſurrection of Chriſt raiſing us up from the death of ſin and darkneſſe, to live with him to God in newneſſe of life is that which every man and woman ought to look earneſtly after in this world.</p>
               <p>And now ſome may imagine that this ſpiritual reſurrection is not the thing meant in this 20 Chap. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> becauſe 't is ſaid to be a thouſand years, and then to be finiſhed, and Satan to be looſed out of his priſon again, to whom I anſwer, that the thouſand years has reſpect to the reign of Chriſt in the Saints in all ages, during the time of every diſpenſation of God towards his people in the world; and ſo the firſt reſurrection has ſtill been paſſed through, and is to be paſſed through by all the people of God here, and finiſhed at their departure hence in the Lord, and as this reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was more glorious in <hi>John</hi>'s time, and the firſt ages of the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt than before under the Law, ſo it ſhall be more glorious yet than ever before; called therefore the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wherein God ſhall come down and dwell with men; to wit, more in the fulneſſe and glory of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit than in all the diſpenſations that have gone before, and the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the reſurrection is, the more the evil ſhall be bound; and the appearing of this in all ages has been the binding of Satan, and is that which limits, and puts a ſtop to this Kingdom, and ſo a torment to him before his time, and the more this grows, the more he ſhall bound, &amp; ſo the great binding of Satan ſhall be, not by a perſonal reign of Chriſt in a body, but by the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or more eminent reign of Chriſt yet in the fulneſſe of the ſpirit; this is that which every Saint is to look at in himſelf, and not to put off the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from himſelf to ſome other men, or ſome other time: but to look at his own reſurrection, and the binding of Satan in his own ſoul, as well as without in others, that he may reign with Chriſt here, and hereafter; in the 12. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 9. we read of a war in Heaven, and of a great fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Dragon and <hi>Michael,</hi> but the Dragon and his Angels prevail'd not, but are caſt out, and their place is found no more in Heaven, this is that we are to look at in our ſelves, for the Church of God is the Kingdom of God on earth, and where this Kingdom is ſet up, there Satans Kingdom is pulled down, and his time finiſhed; I ſay, where Chriſt is ſet up in power, 't is ſo, not where he's onely ſet up in ſhew, for where things are but in ſhew, there the unclean ſpirit is ſaid to go out, not to be driven away by the ſun of God, but to feign a going away, and ſo to return again, and bring 7 other ſpirits, that is, more power along with him, and finding the houſe ſwept and garniſhed, to enter in again and dwell there, and ſo to make the laſt ſtate
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47261:62"/> worſe than the firſt; but when he's caſtout by the finger of God, then we have the true Champion on our ſide, and now the evil one muſt leave the houſe for ever: and further, though the Scriptures ſpeak of a finiſhing the thouſand years, yet that is meant in reference unto every diſpenſation of God to his people here, and their abode with Chriſt, during this ſpirituall reign with them in this body; when Chriſt reigns with us here, this is the firſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and when Chriſt takes us unto himſelf out of the body, then this is finiſhed; and this is ſaid to be a thouſand years, in reference to the Saints in all generations: But where's Satan when he's caſt out of the Saints, or out of a particular ſoul? what is he idle, or lies ſtill? no, he goes down to the earth, and therefore woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the Sea; for the Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, becauſe he has but a ſhort time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. when Satan is caſt out of one, he reigns in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the more he's impriſoned in the Church, and kept from hurting, and tempting them by the ſtrong power of God, the more he's tormented, and the more he rages in the world, and the more ſubtile, and cunning, and powerfull he is in the veſſels of wrath, and ſo ſhall gather them together with more ſubtilty, and violence againſt the holy beloved City, becauſe of the great glory that ſhall be poured out on her, that ſo he, and all his followers may reap their deſerved ruine, and woe, at the coming of Chriſt, at the great day of wrath. And ſo to ſumme up this, as the reign of Chriſt draws nigh finiſhing, ſo the reign of Satan; and as the reign of Chriſt towards the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſhall be moſt glorious, ſo Satan moſt furious and crafty in the world, working more in a myſtery, transforming himſelf into an Angel of light by his goodly outward ſhews, and obſervations; getting into the hearts of men, ſaying he's God, and he's Chriſt, and by this means he ſhall be more fitted to deceive, and prevail with <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to gather them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Saints, and people of God every where, being given up as a juſt puniſhment from God, for following their own vain imaginations: I ſay, the Nations ſhall be deceived, as a juſt judgement of God upon them, and vvorſhip the Dragon, and the beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, and in their pride ſhall think to ſwallow up all, and then receive their final overthrow, ruine, and woe, when a fire ſhall be kindled in the whole frame of nature, to diſſolve the world, and the works therein, and all the wicked of the earth, high and low, ſhall ſay, hide us from the face of him, who ſits upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> Here according to thine own language thou ſtealeſt the Apoſtles words, and makeſt uſe of them to deceive the ſimple: but thy ſhifts are ſeen, and thou thy ſelf has pulled off the cover, and manifeſted by all thy carriage that thy commiſſion comes from another power, even thine own will, thy proud haughty minde, that takeſt this honour upon thee before thou art anointed of God; and therefore thou art found to be a ſtriker, brawler, of no good behaviour, not apt to teach, but to ſcoffe and rail, a novice lifted up with pride, a little knowledge and wiſdom thou haſt received formerly, but it has perverted thee, puffed thee up, and ſo 't is taken away, and fallen thou art into the ſnare, and condemnation of the Devil, and ſo all thy preaching which thou art anointed to, tends to the bringing up an evil report upon the loweſt degree of a man, brotherly and orderly humanity, much more upon the higheſt, the high profeſſion of Chriſtianity; ſo far thou art from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Chriſtian, that thou art not a man; ſo far from being a man, that thou art below a beaſt; for the Oxe knows his honour, and the Aſſe his Maſters Crib, but thou regardeſt not the Lord nor man; and yet thy father has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded thee, and told thee thou haſt a commiſſion from Chriſt revealed in thee; but when did Chriſt, revealed in any, teach them to preach another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and to ſay 't is a great ſin to pull off the hat, and to make any ſhadow of reſpect, to honour, fear, or reverence any, to whom 't is due; nay, not the image of God in fathers, maſters, aged people, and governours, contrary to the Letter and meaning, both of Law and Goſpel; and where did Chriſt ſay it was a great ſin? nay, the language of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſay, you, inſtead of thou, and yes, inſtead of yea, to wear Bands, Cuffs, Ribbins, or the like, ſo as men did it with gravity; ſurely Chriſt has ſomething elſe to declare where he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47261:68"/> anoints to preach: Further, where did Chriſt command to preach up the light of nature, inſtead of the light of grace? as if the poor dark world had had light ſufficient within, and there had been no need of his coming, or ſpirit, or Scripture; and where did Chriſt command to preach up the power and freedom, and will of man? as if man had all already, and had no need to be endued with power from an high; and where did Chriſt command to preach up our merits, our holineſſe, our obſervations, or ſo much as the bloud of our own ſins, to juſtifie us in the ſight of God, and to make his merits, and bloud, and Croſſe a ſcorn, and deriſion among the Heathen? where did Chriſt thus diſhonour himſelf, to exalt proud fleſh and man? where did Chriſt call the Scriptures, Letter, Ink, and Paper, not known to any till this generation; Friend, I know, notwithſtanding all this, thou canſt not ſee thy ſhame, but art like an hungry man that dreams he eats, but when he awakes, his Soul is empty; ſo in thy dream thou eateſt and thou drinkeſt, and thou haſt paſſed through all, death, judgement, reſurrection, not in part, but in whole, and through thine own poor, weak light, and power, and skill, thou art gone up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> paſſed through the wilderneſſe, through the Red-ſea, and haſt ſeen all the <hi>Egyptians</hi> drowned, and haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into thy full reſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and no more doeſt thou look for that is to come: thus art thou high in thine imagination, though low enough in thy foundation, even building upon the ſand of thine own will, and though you ſtrike at the very foundations of all ſociety, humanity, charity, Chriſtianity, endeavouring to lay all deſolute, and even with the ground; yet thou, and thy wandring generation muſt all have their Commiſſions from God, and be infallible, and all that will not believe it muſt be <hi>Anathema Maranatha;</hi> Alas, poor wretches, ye have need of pity, but ye cannot pity your ſelves, ye have need of grace, rich mercy, great grace, but ye want none: I ſay no more to yee but this, the ſpirit of the Lord cannot ſtoop to proud mens will; therefore remember your Creatour betimes, look to the Rock from whence ye are hewen, pity <hi>Abraham</hi> your father, and <hi>Sarah</hi> your mother, leave off building up the <hi>Babel</hi> of your own light, power, merits, will, leſt ye be made an hiſſing, aſtoniſhment, and deſolation by the Lord of Hoſts; return to your firſt husband, your firſt love, that we with you may live with him in brotherly-kindneſſe and charity; ſeek not to make the breaches wider, but rather to repair the breaches, and to reconcile people that wander in the dark unto one another in the Lord; ſeek the righteouſneſſe, joy, and peace of the Kingdom, which comes down from the father, walk in the light of the Lord, which will reach you to be as the Lord is unto all men, according to your meaſure you receive, and ſo it may be, lead ſome more of your feet out
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47261:68"/> of this cunning ſnare; &amp; as for me, notwithſtanding all your hard ſpeeches, which the evil one in ye has uttered againſt me, yet I ſhall not ceaſe to be your friend before the Throne of grace, deſiring to ſee, and finde your hearts filled with ſorrow and trembling for all your errours, and myſtical infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſo the name of <hi>Babylon</hi> may not ſtill be written upon your fore-heads, who is called, Myſtery, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the Mother of Harlots, and of the abominations of the earth; but rather the new name, the name of God, of the new Citie, the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> which comes down from heaven, that ſo you may ſee your perfection here in the midſt of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, and may come to that perfection hereafter, which is in the midſt of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and joy of God.</p>
